These are Sublime Text-compatible color themes based upon the themes described in [Monochrome Color Themes for Xcode](http://undefinedvalue.com/2015/02/01/monochrome-color-themes-xcode).

## Installation

The easiest way to install the color schemes is by using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io). Install Package Control, and then install the [Monochrome Color Schemes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Monochrome%20Color%20Schemes) package.

```

Then choose one of the themes from the *Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Monochrome* submenu.
